Interactive 360° Spin Platform

== Description ==

* Create interactive 360 product photography


* Let your customers see your product from all angles

* Fast, easy, and beautiful way to increase engagement

If you’ve ever wanted an easy way to create a 360° interactive video to show off a new product, Arqspin has you covered. Visit arqspin.com to learn more!

**How it works:**

Arqspin is a 360° photography solution that works right from your phone, tablet, or DSLR camera. Simply place your object on a turntable and use our free iOS app to capture, edit, and share an interactive 360° spin, or use your own camera and our online editor.

The Arqspin WooCommerce Extension lets you connect spins from your arqspin.com account to your WooCommerce store in only a few short clicks.

**Why 360?:**

Large e-commerce retailers have been using 360° photography for years to allow their customers to more completely experience products before they purchase.

360° photography has also been shown to reduce returns and lower customer service requests by helping customers educate themselves before purchasing.

"... products with a 360-degree spin feature have conversion rate at least 10% higher and sometimes as much as 30-40% higher than products without it." -Internet Retailer Magazine

**Why now?:**

Most equipment currently used to make 360° photography costs anywhere from $2,000-$5,000. These complex proprietary systems are difficult to setup and use. Studios that offer 360° photography services typically charge anywhere from $150-$250 per product shot.

We leveraged our deep expertise in computer vision to create Arqspin, a much simpler and more affordable way to make 360° photography. All you need is a smartphone or video camera and a way to rotate the object you want to spin (anything from a lazy susan to a motorized turntable will work). Now, you can showcase your products like the largest e-commerce merchants in the world.
